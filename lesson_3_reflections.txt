When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would want a remote repository if I was going to be working on different computers, or if I wanted to collaborate with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If I was collaborating with Others, for example, I might want to review their changes to the remote repository before pulling them to my local version.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are specific to GitHub. If I fork a repository, I am creating a copy of a repository on GitHub in my own GitHub account. A clone is when I copy a repository either locally on my computer, or I copy a remote repository from GitHub onto my local computer. Branches work at the commit level, and do not operate on repositories themselves.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
THe benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally is that, if you're offline for a while, you can still access the last saved version.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
I could collaborate using email or chat to send proposed changes back and forth, but it would be difficult to keep track of everything, especially if there were several collaborators. Also, it would probably be more difficult to resolve merge conflicts.
