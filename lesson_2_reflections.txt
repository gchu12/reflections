What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It starts a new repository from a directory. This is necessary in order to start making commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is an intermediate step between the working directory and the repository. It allows me to collect files that go together, and package them into one commit.
