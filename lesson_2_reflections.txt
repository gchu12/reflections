What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It starts a new repository from a directory. This is necessary in order to start making commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is an intermediate step between the working directory and the repository. It allows me to collect files that go together, and package them into one commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
I can check the staging area to verify the changes in it before making the commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
If I wanted to make different versions of a project, branches would help to keep them separate and track the history of each.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
The diagrams are helpful for understanding branches and reachability, because I can see the arrows pointing back. It is still hard to wrap my head around how Git works, and how I'm making all these changes in the same .js file, but everything somehow gets logged and I can access previous versions.
